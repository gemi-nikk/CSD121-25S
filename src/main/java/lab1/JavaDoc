This Java program is a simple but practical tool that collects some basic information from the user—like their name, age, and a couple of numbers—performs a bit of number processing, and then saves everything into a file called output.txt. It starts by asking the user for their name and age. Once the age is entered, it checks whether the person is an adult or a minor and displays a message accordingly.
After that, the program asks the user to enter two numbers, twice: once to store them in a dynamic list (ArrayList) and once in a regular array (int[]). For each number entered, it calculates the double using a helper method and shows the result on the screen.
Finally, all the collected data—name, age, numbers from both the list and the array—are written to a file. This part uses a FileWriter inside a try-catch block, which helps handle any file-related errors (like if the file can't be created or written to). The program also closes the scanner properly at the end to avoid any memory issues.
what the code does:
Takes input from the user for name, age, and numbers.
Checks age to decide if the user is a minor or an adult.
Stores numbers in both a list and an array.
Doubles the numbers using a reusable function.
Saves everything to a file in a nicely formatted way.
Some challenges i faced during tha lab
Mixing nextLine() with number inputs can sometimes skip lines—this was solved by using nextLine() consistently and converting inputs to numbers manually.
Writing to a file might fail due to permissions or file access issues, but wrapping it in a try-catch made it more reliable.
Properly closing the Scanner and FileWriter was important to avoid resource leaks, and was handled in a finally block.
overall,this program is a solid example of using Java for real-world tasks like interacting with users, working with different data structures, and saving results to a file—all while handling possible errors gracefully. Let me know if you'd like this saved in a document or markdown file.
